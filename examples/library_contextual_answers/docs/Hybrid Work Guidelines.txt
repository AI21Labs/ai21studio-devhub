Hybrid Work Guidelines
ExampleTech 's hybrid work guidelines outlines remote employees' work and compliance expectations. The purpose of this hybrid work guidelines is to safeguard both employees' and the organization's interests by outlining the working conditions and expectations.


At our current stage of growth, we believe face-to-face interaction is valuable for team building, cross-functional collaboration, and for reducing friction in the work process. Because we’re a fast paced, growing company, we recommend you arrive at the office every day to take advantage of the benefits of in-person communication.


Having said that, working from home also has its own benefits and we want to cultivate a culture of trust and flexibility. Therefore we've outlined a hybrid option that combines the best of both worlds.


We ask every employee to arrive at the office at least three times a week. In the remaining two days of the week, employees can choose between working from the office or from home. To make sure you meet your teammates regularly, your team manager will set 1-2 weekdays for the whole team to arrive together.


A few things to keep in mind:
- There might be times you will be asked to arrive at the office more often, depending on specific projects / efforts that require your presence (such as face-to-face interviews, team member onboarding, etc.).
- Please make sure to mark your calendar for “work from home” / “work from office” so that others know where to reach you. If you’re not sure how, follow these guidelines.
- We understand that from time to time, there are extenuating circumstances that require you to be at home more than usual. In those cases, please talk to your manager to decide on a plan.
