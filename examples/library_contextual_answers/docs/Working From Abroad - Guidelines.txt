Working From Abroad - Guidelines


ExampleTech allows every employee to work remotely while abroad for up to two weeks (10 working days) in a calendar year. These two weeks can be used all at once or spread throughout the year.


We ask employees who want to make use of this policy to approve their request at least a month in advance with their direct manager, to leave time to make the needed preparations.


Employees who work remotely are expected to be available during the peak working hours of the main office (generally 10:00-16:00), as well as during scheduled meetings.


We will consider each request carefully with the aim to make it happen, though it might not always be possible. Your request might not be approved if your physical presence is required for a specific team effort or deadline, or if the time difference does not allow smooth communication. Please take your team responsibilities into consideration before making a request.


A few more details:
- Please update your calendar for all days you are available while working remotely.
- In case of special circumstances that donâ€™t fall into the above mentioned guidelines
(such as employees whose family is based abroad), please talk to your manager and a special approval will be considered accordingly.
- You will be asked to fill in a statement form (for Insurance and Security purposes) before going on your trip, please make sure to do so.
