Annoyed that he constantly calls on them without any gratitude, they go back home to play Minecraft, with the President quickly finding out. The resulting argument leads to a battle of egos that culminates in a fight in the White House between Rick and the President's security. Meanwhile, fearing she might be a clone made by Rick, Beth reunites with Jerry to figure out the truth. Shortly after, the entire family gets together to hide from Rick, but he tracks them down. Rick eventually submits to Jerry once again being a family member. Rick ends his conflict with the President by pretending to be Fly Fishing Rick, a Rick from a different reality, and calling a truce.

      "To bolster Jerry's self-esteem, Rick takes him on an adventure at Morty's request. They visit an otherworldly resort within an immortality field so Jerry won't be harmed while away. Jerry encounters Risotto Groupon, an alien who blames Rick for his kingdom being usurped. Risotto enlists Jerry in a plot to kill Rick, but Jerry backs out after Rick apologizes for ruining his marriage. The attempt fails, and Rick realizes Jerry's involvement, sparking a monologue of him accusing Jerry of deliberately acting helpless to guilt others into helping him, such as making Beth feel she was obligated to marry him. After Rick kills Risotto, he softens his attitude towards Jerry, but refuses to allow him to return to the family. Meanwhile, Summer deals with self-esteem issues as well. Her boyfriend, Ethan, leaves her for a larger-breasted girlfriend, and Summer attempts to enlarge her own breasts using one of Rick's devices. Her aim is off, and she grows to bizarre proportions. Morty wants to call Rick for assistance, but Beth refuses. Arrogantly trying to prove her own self-worth, Beth repeatedly fails to fix the problem and ends up turning Summer inside-out. Beth is then tricked into releasing three tiny technical support workers that were trapped inside the machine when she calls for tech support. Summer disappears to the campsite she and Ethan were supposed to go, still inside out. Beth turns herself inside out and talks to Summer. Once Morty figures out how the machine works, he restores Summer's size and spitefully uses it to deform Ethan in an act of vengeance.\n",

The Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks arrests him and finds him guilty, upon discovering incriminating evidence which was actually fabricated to frame him. Rick and Morty escape and are chased by a few duplicates of themselves. The Smith household is flooded with other Ricks and Jerry develops a friendship with the good-natured \"Doofus Rick\". The real culprits seem to be an \"Evil\" Rick and his Evil Morty, who have been using Mortys' low intelligence brainwaves as a way to conceal themselves.

Rick informs the Council about the real killer, thus clearing his own name. After Rick and Morty depart, the Council discovers that Evil Rick was actually under control by an unknown puppet-master, which was Evil Morty all along.

Rick calls Summer, who transports them advanced armor suits. Morty then goes on a seemingly uncharacteristic killing spree before Rick knocks him out, and he and Arthricia—who desired to stop the Festival—storm the castle of the corrupt nobility who introduced it, slaughtering them. The planet's remaining inhabitants decide to create a new society; however, rioting breaks out over disputes, and one suggests keeping the Festival after all.

      "Summary: Morty finds an alien cockroach living in Jerry's toilet, and decides to keep it as a pet. The alien, named Mr. Meeseeks, promises to do whatever Morty wants, and follows through with his requests. Morty asks him to search for a portal gun, and, after Meeseeks finds it, the cockroach continuously uses it to travel around the universe and fulfill more tasks. Rick and Morty have adventures in alternate dimensions, including a world where Rick is worshiped as a god, and one in which Morty is the dominant species. Morty becomes addicted to having Meeseeks fulfill his wishes, to the neglect of his family. He eventually has Meeseeks build him a portal gun, but realizes how horrible it is to be worshiped as a god and destroys the portal. Meeseeks asks Rick to destroy him, but Rick refuses, leaving Meeseeks trapped on the Smiths' bathroom floor. Morty finally realizes how obsessed and pathetic he is, and begs Meeseeks to kill him. Meeseeks agrees, but first takes Morty to a world where the citizens of the Galactic Federation have invited him to a palace. Meeseeks reveals that he is actually a god-like being from another universe, and explains that he has come to Earth as part of a greater plan. He sends Morty back to Earth, but Morty's family, believing that Morty has returned as a hero, celebrates his birthday. Meeseeks is unable to find Morty, and disappears in frustration.\n"

As Summer and both Beths travel back to the Citadel to establish an interdimensional beacon, Rick learns that Rick Prime was also transported by the reset. The original Jerry tells Morty that his Beth and Summer did not survive being frozen in \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\"[a]. Jerry abandons Morty in order to move on. Rick rescues Morty and takes him to confront Rick Prime but finds an elaborate trap. Morty convinces him to save the rest of the family instead. However, once the family picks up Jerry and returns home, they are confronted by Season Two Jerry, who releases an alien named Mr. Frundles that rapidly replicates and forces the family to relocate to a replacement dimension where their counterparts all died.\n",

      "The show's original Rick is wrongfully accused of murdering twenty-seven Ricks from alternate dimensions and kidnapping their respective Mortys. The Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks arrests him and finds him guilty, upon discovering incriminating evidence which was actually fabricated to frame him. Rick and Morty escape and are chased by a few duplicates of themselves. The Smith household is flooded with other Ricks and Jerry develops a friendship with the good-natured \"Doofus Rick\". The real culprits seem to be an \"Evil\" Rick and his Evil Morty, who have been using Mortys' low intelligence brainwaves as a way to conceal themselves. They capture the original Rick and Morty, but the original Morty leads a rebellion of alternate Mortys and releases the original Rick. Rick informs the Council about the real killer, thus clearing his own name. After Rick and Morty depart, the Council discovers that Evil Rick was actually under control by an unknown puppet-master, which was Evil Morty all along. Evil Morty escapes by blending into the crowd of Mortys without a Rick.\n",

Their goal is to recover Tommy, Beth's childhood friend who has been trapped in Froopyland, and prevent the execution of his father, who is being falsely accused of eating him. Tommy, who has survived all these years by resorting to bestiality, incest and cannibalism, refuses to return to the real world. Rick and Beth manage to save his father's life by creating a clone of Tommy. Back at home, Beth is presented with the option of having a replacement clone of her created, so that she will be free to travel the world. Meanwhile, Jerry dates an alien hunter named Kiara, to Morty and Summer's dismay. When he decides to get out of the relationship, Kiara is enraged and tries to kill the kids, whom she holds responsible. The situation is resolved following the revelation that Kiara was using Jerry to get over her previous boyfriend, much like Jerry was doing with her.\n",

      "Rick and Morty visit another planet to purchase wiper fluid and witness \"The Festival\", an annual event where the local populace commits crimes for one night without consequence. After initial hesitation, Morty forces Rick to rescue Arthricia, a young alien girl, who proceeds to betray them, stealing Rick's gun and spaceship. Rick calls Summer, who transports them advanced armor suits. Morty then goes on a seemingly uncharacteristic killing spree before Rick knocks him out, and he and Arthricia—who desired to stop the Festival—storm the castle of the corrupt nobility who introduced it, slaughtering them. The planet's remaining inhabitants decide to create a new society; however, rioting breaks out over disputes, and one suggests keeping the Festival after all. Morty feels guilt over his rampage, but Rick (falsely) blames it on the effects of a candy bar he ate, and asserts that his character remains unchanged.\n",

Story Lord steals Rick's device which allows him to travel to the real world and seek out his creator, Jan. Meanwhile, Rick and Morty, seeking a way back to the real world, infiltrate the fortress of the \"Self-Referential Six\", a group of \"meta nerds\" who all have reality-warping powers based on narrative techniques and devices (such as plot twists and continuity errors), but are attacked by the group and forced to flee back into the meta. They are rescued by Joseph Campbell, who assists them in creating a device to return to the real world to confront Story Lord. Jan and Story Lord have created a machine capable of siphoning motivation from the universe's inhabitants to fuel Story Lord's own \"motivation.\" Morty, with the assistance of a spectral Campbell, convinces Jan to stop operating the machine, depowering Story Lord and allowing Rick to defeat him. At Morty's and Campbell's prompting, Jan kills Story Lord. After Rick and Morty depart, he becomes inspired to continue writing, much to the spectral Campbell's dismay.\n",

Morty asks him to search for a portal gun, and, after Meeseeks finds it, the cockroach continuously uses it to travel around the universe and fulfill more tasks. Rick and Morty have adventures in alternate dimensions, including a world where Rick is worshiped as a god, and one in which Morty is the dominant species.

Rick eventually reveals all he wants is for Morty and Summer to become \"more proactive.\" Back at Smith headquarters, Rick and Smith are revealed to be robots. The clown is revealed to be the creator of Rick and Smith, and after Rick and Smith tell him what he wants, he reprograms them. Rick and Smith then attempt to destroy Morty and Summer, but Smith is convinced by Morty to spare Summer's life. Rick and Smith are reprogrammed by Summer and Morty to become \"more proactive\". Summer and Morty are freed from their hypnosis and return home. Rick and Smith confront the clown, who reveals that, rather than destroying Rick and Smith, he was planning on using them to destroy the universe.\n"
