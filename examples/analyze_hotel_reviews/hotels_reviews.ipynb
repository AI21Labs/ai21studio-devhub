I was able to contact the front desk and say that I wanted the upgrade and was heading downstairs to get a new room. I was in essence told I was a liar, there was no upgrade for me, but they would give me a new room.  The rooms were both gross, not cleaned under the beds, and spray on the pictures in the rooms.

      "The staff was notably friendly, helpful and happy.  Tommy at the front desk always greeted us with a smile and assisted us with a room change.  The hotel itself is a bit tired, the air conditioning was not very efficient and paint job in some areas needed repairs. But it suited our purpose and would consider staying there again. \n",
      "===========================\n",
      "The Hotel was clean, accessible, and close to everything. The staff was kind, professional, and a pleasure to connect with. Rooms were well appointed. Even with a roof top bar, the hotel was quiet on the 4th floor. Highly recommend. \n",
      "===========================\n",
      "When we checked it we were offered a free upgrade by the person at the desk however would need to wait 30 minutes.  We declined as we just wanted to rest. Once we got to our room, it was freezing with no ability to adjust the AC unit, the TV was broken and when trying to call from the phone, the cord was frayed an almost ripped out of the phone.  I was able to contact the front desk and say that I wanted the upgrade and was heading downstairs to get a new room. I was in essence told I was a liar, there was no upgrade for me, but they would give me a new room.  The rooms were both gross, not cleaned under the beds, and spray on the pictures in the rooms.  The room also needed significant repair.  It is crazy that is what so sub par considering the cost.\n",

      "Just terrible. Although we suffer bed bag, they charge us full amount and no apologies. They kept us 30min in the reception to check bed bug and found bed bag, but no apologies. Further we agreed to cancel all, but they charge us afterwards. We would like to request compensation for suffering bedbugs. \n",

The staff was friendly but hard to reach. The location was excellent and the Rooftop Restaurant was awesome. I also don’t appreciate that I was not told the pool was closed prior to my arrival- it’s advertised as having a pool. I expected much better quality for the price I paid to stay in this Hotel\n",
      "===========================\n",
      "We arrived early, and asked at the desk if they can hold our luggage and check in. The woman behind the counter (Sept 10,2022) was having a bad day perhaps because she was not smiling, rude and when my friend asked for some waters she really got annoyed. We were crammed in our room, there was four people. No mini fridge, no Keurig, no ice bucket and no wash cloths only three hand towels. The bathroom was so small it was hard to walk into it and turn to use the toilet. Room service personnel were a delight. Smiles and happy to help us out. When I had to ask the front desk for four bath towels, the woman again helped me but gave me the look and rolls her eyes. I paid over $600.00 to stay at this hotel and I really thing they could of treated me better, even if it was service with a smile. The rooftop bar was nothing to write home about but the staff were good with people.\n",

No one really went out of their way to help us stay in the same room so we had to check out and go to a new room. It’s okay tho I understand some of those things are out of some hands.  It also worked out bec our first room’s AC didn’t seem to be working. If I had to complain about one thing, we got a “new” towel from the shower rack (folded) to dry off and the towel smelled like fresh vomit. That was pretty gross.

They moved us to another room which was a bit better, but no instructions on how to work the tv; one phone didn't work, they didn't give us new towels when asked and I could go on and on.

You are virtually steps away from Lincoln Center and a few more to Juliard. Then it’s a hop skip and jump to Central Park and Columbus Circle.\\nThe lobby and door staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. And special kudos to the cleaning staff. They didn’t miss a beat and kept our room and the hallways immaculately clean.\\nThe wi-fi really sucks! Can’t believe they are allowed to claim it as an amenity.\\nThe rooftop lounge allows you to overlook the wi-fi.\\nExtracted sentiment:\\n{\\\"Location\\\": \\\"Positive\\\", \\\"Cleaning\\\": \\\"Positive\\\", \\\"Service\\\": \\\"Positive\\\", \\\"WiFi\\\": \\\"Negative\\\"}\\n##Review:\\n\"\n",
